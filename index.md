I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at Stanford University and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. This upcoming fall I will start as an associate at Connerstone Research in San Francisco.

I am an applied microeconomist with a focus on empirical industrial organization. In my job market paper I study how historcialy dominant producers of consumer packaged goods responded to product differentiation by "independent" entrants. I am advised by Liran Einav, Ali Yurukoglu, and Jose Ignacio Cuesta.

From 2018 to 2021 I was a research assistant to Amitabh Chandra at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. In 2018, I graduated cum laude from Rice University with a B.A. in Mathematical Economic Analysis and Mathematics.
