I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at Stanford University and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. I am on the 2025-2026 job market seeking economic consulting positions. 
I am interested in Industrial Organization and in my job market paper (to be posted mid-November), I study how historcially dominant producers of consumer packaged goods respond to entry by "craft" or "independent" firms. I am advised by Liran Einav, Ali Yurukoglu, and Jose Ignacio Cuesta.

From 2018-2021 I was a research assistant to Amitabh Chandra at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. In 2018, I graduated cum laude from Rice University with a B.A. in Mathematical Economic Analysis and Mathematics.
