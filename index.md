I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at Stanford University and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. I am on the 2025-2026 job market seeking industry and economic consulting positions. 

I am interested in empirical industrial organization and applied microeconomics. In my job market paper (available mid-november), I study how historcially dominant producers of consumer packaged goods respond to entry by small "independent" firms. I am advised by Liran Einav, Ali Yurukoglu, and Jose Ignacio Cuesta.

From 2018 to 2021 I was a research assistant to Amitabh Chandra at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. In 2018, I graduated cum laude from Rice University with a B.A. in Mathematical Economic Analysis and Mathematics.
