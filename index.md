I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at Stanford University and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. I am interested in industrial organization, public, and health economics.

From 2018-2021 I was a research assistant to Prof. Amitabh Chandra at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. In 2018, I graduated from Rice University with a B.A. in Mathematical Economic Analysis and Mathematics. 

Ouside of Economics, I am a drummer, biker, and a (hopeful?) Baltimore Orioles fan.
