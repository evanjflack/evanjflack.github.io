I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at Stanford University and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. I am on the 2025-2026 job market seeking economic consulting positions. 
My primary field is Industrial Organization and in my job market paper (to be posted mid-November) I study how large, legacy producers of consumer packaged goods have responded to entry by "craft" or "independent" firms.

From 2018-2021 I was a research assistant to Prof. Amitabh Chandra at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. In 2018, I graduated from Rice University with a B.A. in Mathematical Economic Analysis and Mathematics.
