**"Detecting Behavioral Hazard"** with Amitabh Chandra and Ziad Obermeyer

Abstract: Do patients miscalculate the benefit of health care relative to the price they pay for it? We use data from Medicare's prescription drug benefit program to demonstrate three facts about consumer decision making, and its health consequences. First, we show that a cost-sharing increase of 14.9% (7.62 percentage points, p.p., or $10.05 more per drug) causes a 24.5% drop in total drug consumption ($66.20), and a 35.8% spike in monthly mortality (0.052 p.p.). A key part of our identification strategy is a predictive model of drug expenditures, which allows us to isolate variation in how different individuals respond to the same cost-sharing policy. By incorporating these predictions into a two-stage least squares setup, where beneficiaries' birth month drives variation in year-end prices, we are able to precisely estimate effects on mortality. Second, to make sense of these large effects, we show that cutbacks affect some of the most life-saving drugs prescribed in this population. This is true both on average, based on clinical trial effect size estimates for drugs like statins and antihypertensives, and at the individual patient level: those who stand to benefit the most -- patients at highest predicted risk of heart attack and stroke -- cut back at least as much as these drugs as patients at lower risk. We find similar patterns for other drug--disease pairs, and irrespective of socioeconomic circumstance. Third, we find evidence of simple, yet deadly, empirical regularities in patient behavior: price increases cause 18% more patients (2.77 p.p.) to fill *no* drugs, regardless of how many drugs they had been on previously, or their individualized health risks. This behavior mechanically results in larger absolute reductions in utilization for those on many drugs. The presence of this 'behavioral hazard,' and the specific behaviors underlying it, confirms that the price elasticity of demand is an insufficient statistic for insurance design and welfare. It also suggests that efforts to make out-of-pocket prices -- and the consumer choice calculus in general -- more salient could have unintended consequences.

**"Responding to Decision Maker Tendencies: Evidence from Major League Baseball"**

Abstract: 
How do people learn about, and respond to the tendencies of a decision maker? I study this question in the context of batters and umpires in Major League Baseball (MLB). Using detailed in-game data on pitch location and outcomes, I show that batters learn about a given umpire's strike zone over the course of the game. Batters are more likely to swing when the home plate umpire tends to call more strikes than balls, but only in later innings, after they have had the opportunity to personally study the umpire's calls. This pattern is particularly pronounced on pitches where one would expect the umpire to have more discretion: those close to edge of the strike zone. Because umpires (and thus their tendencies) are quasi-randomly assigned to games, I interpret this as the causal effect of the umpire's tendency on the batter's decision. While many may view baseball as unimportant, human ability to learn about tendencies has implications for a wide array of other areas such as how both prosecutors and defense attorneys adapts their strategies given a judge's tendencies.
