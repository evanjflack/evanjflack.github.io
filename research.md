**"Detecting Behavioral Hazard in Health Care"** with Amitabh Chandra and Ziad Obermeyer

Abstract: 
Do patients miscalculate the benefit of health care relative to the price they pay for it? We study the effect of out-of-pocket price increases in Medicare's prescription drug benefit program, and show three facts about consumer decision making, and its health consequences. First, cost-sharing increases of 22% (10.1 percentage points, or \$12.5) cause 32.0% reductions in spending, and 42% increases in monthly mortality. Machine learning plays a key role in detecting this effect: by integrating predictions on individual-level responses to cost-sharing into a standard instrumental variables setup, we are able to pinpoint subgroups of consumers in whom catastrophic health outcomes are concentrated. Second, to put these large effects in context, we note that patients cut back the most on drugs with large therapeutic benefits. Indeed, for life-saving drugs like statins and antihypertensives, patients who stand to benefit the most -- those at highest risk of conditions like heart attack and stroke -- cut back at least as much as lower-risk groups. We find similar patterns for other drug--disease pairs, and irrespective of socioeconomic circumstance. Third, we find evidence of simple, yet deadly, heuristics: price increases cause 22% more patients (3.5 percentage points) to fill no drugs, regardless of how many drugs they had been on previously, or their individualized health risks. This behavior, which suggests patients may simply abandon the choice calculus altogether, mechanically results in larger absolute reductions in utilization for those on many drugs, and drives mortality effects on the margin. The presence of this `behavioral hazard' implies that the price elasticity of demand is an insufficient statistic for insurance design and welfare, and that efforts to make out-of-pocket prices more salient may do harm.

**"Responding to Decision Maker Tendencies: Evidence from Major League Baseball"**

Abstract: 
How do people learn about, and respond to the tendencies of a decision maker? I study this question in the context of batters and umpires in Major League Baseball (MLB). Using detailed in-game data on pitch location and outcomes, I show that batters learn about a given umpire's strike zone over the course of the game. Batters are more likely to swing when the home plate umpire tends to call more strikes than balls, but only in later innings, after they have had the opportunity to personally study the umpire's calls. This pattern is particularly pronounced on pitches where one would expect the umpire to have more discretion: those close to edge of the strike zone. Because umpires (and thus their tendencies) are quasi-randomly assigned to games, I interpret this as the causal effect of the umpire's tendency on the batter's decision. While many may view baseball as unimportant, human ability to learn about tendencies has implications for a wide array of other areas such as how both prosecutors and defense attorneys adapts their strategies given a judge's tendencies.
