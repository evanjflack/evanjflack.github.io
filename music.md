### [Rockwood](https://www.rockwoodtheband.com)
Right now, I play with Rockwood, a five-piece roots-rock group based in Boston, MA. We released our self-titled debut EP in January 2020, and in the pre-covid world gigged around the Boston area. Check out our music on [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/rockwoodtheband/) and [Soundcloud](https://www.soundcloud.com/rockwoodtheband/) and follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rockwoodtheband/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/rockwoodtheband/) to stay up to date!

### [Steve Cox's Beard](https://soundcloud.com/stevecoxsbeard)
As an undergraduate at Rice, I played in the eight-piece jazz fusion group Steve Cox's Beard (named after an applied math professor with a legendary beard). The group has three studio records: Clean Shaven, Aftershave, and Five O'clock Shadow, all available on [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/stevecoxsbeard/) and  [Soundcloud](https://www.soundcloud.com/stevecoxsbeard/).
