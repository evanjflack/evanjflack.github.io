Outside of economics, I am jazz and rock drummer. 

### [Rockwood](rockwoodtheband.com)
Right now, I play with Rockwood, a 5-perice root-rock group based in Boston, MA. We released our self-titled debut EP in 2020.


### [Steve Cox's Beard](soundcloud.com/stevecoxsbeard)
As an undergraduate at Rice, I played in the eight-perice jazz fusion group Steve Cox's Beard (named after an applied math professor with a legendary beard).
