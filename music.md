### Holyfrancis

I currently play in a four-piece alt-country band, Hollyfrancis, based in Oakland, CA. 

### [Rockwood](https://www.rockwoodtheband.com)
During my time in the Boston area I played with Rockwood, a five-piece roots-rock group. The band released its self-titled debut EP in January 2020 and a second EP "Another Day" in late 2020, both available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/24mfBSKbHHz9RwrWZupJGC) and [Soundcloud](https://www.soundcloud.com/rockwoodtheband/).

### [Steve Cox's Beard](https://soundcloud.com/stevecoxsbeard)
As an undergraduate at Rice, I played in the eight-piece jazz fusion group Steve Cox's Beard. The group has three studio records: "Clean Shaven", "Aftershave", and "Five O'clock Shadow", all available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/35ICIVtb8HVfaIOvZ6uStL) and  [Soundcloud](https://www.soundcloud.com/stevecoxsbeard/).
