I am seeking one or more skilled and highly motivated individuals for full-time research assistance. A commitment of at least one year is required, but interest in two years is preferred. I am an economist doing empirical research related to health care and public economics.

The role will involve close collaboration with my coauthors, other research assistants, and me, and will provide the research assistant with substantial exposure to the research process. The various assignments will provide an opportunity to gain skills and experience relevant for a graduate degree in economics, public policy, or a related discipline. The position is particularly well suited to applicants interested in learning more about health economics and policy, and with prior knowledge of the U.S. healthcare system.

Applicants should be completing (or have completed) a Bachelors or Master’s degree. The ideal candidate will: (i) have a strong quantitative background, including coursework in statistics or econometrics; (ii) have strong computer programming skills, particularly fluency with Stata, R, Python, or Julia programming; (iii) be able to work independently to solve problems; and (iv) have a long-term interest in pursuing research in economics or health care policy. I also value strong writing skills, as the position will include opportunities to edit and draft manuscripts.

The position will be based in Cambridge, MA, at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. The preferred start date is July 1, 2020, but applicants will have the ability to start earlier. The compensation and benefit package are competitive.

To apply, please submit your information via this online [form](https://forms.gle/WiBVvEU4BWvvGXLs9). The form will ask you to upload a resume, transcript(s), and cover letter.

If you have any questions, please email Evan Flack at evan_flack@hks.harvard.edu.
